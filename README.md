## Goal

This repository created to demonstrate how to use PrimeReact's GMap component in full screen with other page elements.

## Background

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

[PrimeReact](https://www.primefaces.org/primereact/) library is also used to embed Google Maps. PrimeReact provides GMap component for integration with Google Maps API.

App.js file is the only file changed, rest is the same as the intial from `Create React App`.
